# Summer Project for GP21 

## Goal:

In the summer project I am interested in development of FPS and TPS shooting systems with blueprints and advanced locomotions. 

The project will be run server side and client side which gives the ability to play as a multiplayer. The reason for this approach is to extend my knowledge in the better understanding of Networking in the Unreal Engine environment.

Side Goals :

The project will have features such as Inventory system, Battle behaviors and variety of interactions of classes. Also I believe that it would be a challenge to overcome and improve my knowledge on the mentioned topics.

Extra encounter topics

Hand to hand Combat system
AI development
AI sensings
Driveable objects (cars, guns)
Mechanical behaviors (Guns, Machines)
Hand To hand Combats
Weapon upgrade system (Maybe)
Particle system
Animations
Camera system
